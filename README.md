# javascript-project

For my first javascript project, I present a wine-cellar organizer app. 

To use:

1. fork and clone in your comp
2. cd into winemaker-api
3. bundle install
4. run rails db:create, then migrate, then seed, then server
5. cd into frontend, and run in terminal: open index.html

You will then be able to create a new wine with associated varietal. Simple CRUD with a few JS bells and whistles.
